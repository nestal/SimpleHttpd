 * \brief A function that handles HTTP requests.

 * set of URIs.
 *
 * These functions are normally implemented in classes that are
 * completely independent of RequestDispatcher or Server. That reduces
 * the coupling between the web server library and business logic. You
 * can easier test the #RequestHandler's without mocking any web server
 * objects.
 *
 * Typically you will pass lambda functions to places that expects
 * #RequestHandler's.
 *
 * You don't need to call Connection::Reply() within the handler function.
 * You can also post another callback to the IoService() and reply there.
 * Typically, you can issue another asynchronous operation, and call
 * Connection::Reply() in the completion callback. In that case, make sure
 * to capture the shared_ptr of Connection (i.e. #ConnectionPtr) _by value_
 * in the lambda callback function. Otherwise the Connection objects will
 * be destroyed if the connection is closed by peer or timed out.
