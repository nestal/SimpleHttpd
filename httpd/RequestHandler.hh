/// A function that handles HTTP requests.
///
/// The RequestHandler is the basic unit of the web server. With a
/// RequestDispatcher, you can add RequestHandler's to handle a specific
/// set of URIs by Server::AddHandler() and Server::SetDefaultHandler().
///
/// These functions are normally implemented in classes that are
/// completely independent of RequestDispatcher or Server. That reduces
/// the coupling between the web server library and business logic. You
/// can easily test the #RequestHandler's without mocking any web server
/// objects. Typically you will pass lambda functions to places that expects
/// #RequestHandler's.
///
/// The RequestHandler will be called when the server has received all
/// headers of the HTTP request. It should return a unique_ptr to a
/// ContentHandler that will process the upcoming content of the
/// request. The ContentHandler will also provide a Response that will
/// be replied to the HTTP client. See ContentHandler for more details.
///
/// In some cases you want to ignore the Request content and reply a
/// Response immediately, you can use AdaptToRequestHandler to create
/// a ContentHandler with a callback function that returns a Response
/// or future<Response>.
///
/// \param Request&     A reference to the Request that is being handled
/// by this function. The reference will always be valid until the
/// connection to client is closed. Typically, the connection will be
/// opened until ContentHandler::OnFinish() is called. You can also
/// terminates the connection prematurely by returning a Response
/// during ContentHandler::OnContent().
///
/// \return A unique_ptr to ContentHandler. The ownership of the
/// ContentHandler will be transferred to the Server obviously.
/// The ContentHandler will handle the content in the HTTP request
/// and react accordingly. If the RequestHandler return a null
/// pointer, the server will reply "Internal Server Error" (500)
/// to clients.
